While established players in the industry work to integrate NFTs in a way that will not be open, offers no agency on the part of the player, and will only serve to clog up the blockchain and exploit the most vulnerable in the gaming community, we aim higher. We are making our own games as a proof-of-concept, but our hope is that our platform can serve as a building block for developers."

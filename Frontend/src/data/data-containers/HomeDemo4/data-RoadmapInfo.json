In addition to the competitive aspect the game will have robust lobbies and low-stakes environments to buy, trade, and show off their NFTs. Both PvE and PvP scenarios will be createdâ€“robust dungeons for players to traverse alone and together in search of more gear. Our most active and talented players will even be able to find rare loot in game to trade and sell for crypto in the real world."

Once all 10k of the initial run are minted, the organic process of minting and burning can begin. Users will be able to burn their items for a chance at creating better (more rare) ones."

// Public Sale date

// 10% -- Exclusive merch drop for our earliest adopters. Owners of OpenRPG NFTs will be able to purchase limited-edition merchandise bespoke to the items within their collection. Hats, mugs, and shirts will be offered each with a certificate of authenticity. 

// 25% -- Early adopters and members of our Discord community will be given access to a limited-time exclusive mint for OpenRPG NFTs. Items minted during the event have a guaranteed rarity, and will come with a unique badge commemorating this one-time-only special event. 

// 50% -- The 2D assets associated with every item minted will get corresponding 3D objects. Users will be able to decide whether they want to represent their NFTs with the 3d or 2d assets online. This is the first step towards creating an entire 3D world for users to play with their items. 

// 75% -- At this point we can begin development on the real heart of this project. A virtual-reality arena and dungeon crawler for players to use make use of their items. Players will be able to stake their loot and in game currency on battles with each other. In addition to the competitive aspect the game will have robust lobbies and low-stakes environments to buy, trade, and show off their NFTs. Both PvE and PvP scenarios will be created, robust dungeons for players to traverse alone and together in search of more gear. Our most active and talented players will even be able to find rare loot in game to trade and sell for crypto in the real world. 

// 100% -- Fadel promises he'll break his monitor (he swear) and get an Ethereum related tattoo that insures he is permanently unemployable for life. To commemorate this stupid activity, we're throwing a HUGE party in Detroit so all of us dumb nerds can LARP together. Maybe we'll even make some real-life items for early adopters to wack each other with. People with OpenRPG loot can use it as their ticket to get in. We'll try and book the Masonic Temple and dress it up in a way that rivals Detroit's legendary Halloween party Theatre Bizarre, and we'll make sure we pay the very same artists to transform the venue so that it really feels like you're transported to another world. When we get here we'll owe you all a tremendous debt, and we plan on sparing no expense to bring you a once in a life time party.
